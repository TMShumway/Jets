# OOP - Jets application

Welcome to my Jets application project. This project simulates an airfield management
system. It allows a user to manage an airfield through a variety of options. Users
can view the airfield fleet, add a jet to the fleet, remove a jet from the fleet, as
well as deploy fighter jets to engage with enemies. The aforementioned list is not
exhaustive. A simple text based UI was implemented with options being chosen through
menus and sub-menus.

### How To Run

This program is a simple java program. As such you are able to run it by opening the JavaApplication.java file in an IDE or terminal and run using the appropriate commands.

### Technologies Used

 - Abstraction
 - Polymorphism
 - Inheritance
 - Encapsulation
 - Loops
 - If else statements
 - Switch statements
 - Input validation
 - Overriding built in methods
 - Field initialization blocks
 - Abstract Classes
 - Interfaces

 ### Lessons Learned

 I really feel like the pieces of OOP started to fall in place with this project.
 The challenge, scope, and breadth of this project helped me cement the importance of Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation. This is definitely the
 largest project I have completed to date. It is also perhaps the first where I
 have had to juggle a more complex and numerous set of classes, who is extending
 and implementing what, and how the inheritance hierarchy can be manipulated to
 create code that is both logical and useful. This project also helped me further
 distinguish the difference between abstract classes and interfaces. Perhaps, more
 important than what I learned to do is what I learned I cannot do. I gained a better
 understanding of my weaknesses in Java and where I can concentrate further study
 efforts to ensure I continue growing as a developer.
